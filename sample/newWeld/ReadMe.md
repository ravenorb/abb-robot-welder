This is my first rendition of the new program, 
I loaded it into the robot and made a couple changes like defining a start point for these values

    PERS robtarget pSafeS1Weld := [[82.84,919.33,1175.90],[0.326608,0.635474,-0.637382,0.288521],[0,0,-1,0],[9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09]];
    PERS robtarget pSetup  := [[-468.06,355.26,385.74],[0.378554,-0.415121,0.806498,0.184206],[1,1,-1,1],[9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09]];
    PERS robtarget pBullseye := [[-468.06,355.26,385.74],[0.378554,-0.415121,0.806498,0.184206],[1,1,-1,1],[9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09,9E+09]];
